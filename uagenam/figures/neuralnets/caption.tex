\textbf{A.} A depiction of a single neuron $z_i^{(l+1)}$ and its inputs from $y_3^{(l)}$, $y_2^{(l)}$, and $y_1^{(l)}$ with weight $w_i^{(l+1)}$ and bias $b_i^{(l+1)}$. The output function $f$ is the output to unit $y_i^{(l+1)}$. \textbf{B.} The general structure of a multi-layer neural network with units depicted as circles and outputs depicted as arrows. \cite{JMLR:v15:srivastava14a}
