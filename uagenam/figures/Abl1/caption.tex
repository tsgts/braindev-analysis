A heatmap of expression values for the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) gene in the developing mouse brain. Expression values were obtained from ISH stains and computed for each region using specialized 3-D voxel counts provided by the Allen Brain Atlas API. The y-axis is the development stage and the x-axis is the brain region (abbreviated). The expression values were transformed to a logarithmic scale to account for skew.
