An example of a multi-layer CNN for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The feature extraction section repeatedly convolves the input image to higher level features, which are fed as inputs to the classification stage. In this case, the classification stage is composed of two fully connected layers, with the final layer outputting the predicted digit classification. \cite{peemen_mesman_corporaal_2011}
