\subsection{Neural networks}
The field of machine learning is often cited as the ``field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed," said by Arthur Samuel in 1959. Today neural networks are one of the most flexible and powerful machine learning algorithms, especially in areas such as pattern recognition and image analysis. The basic neural network node, or \textit{neuron}, is similar to the biological neural network
