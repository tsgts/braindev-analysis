\subsection{Procedure}
This project will be entirely performed on a computer. Gene expression profiles for developing mouse and human brains will be first downloaded from the Allen Brain Atlas. Next, the data will be formatted and transformed into matrices of region versus time expression expression matrices. At this point, there will be two datasets, a developing human dataset and a developing mouse dataset. 


For each dataset, a convolutional neural network algorithm will be applied in order to automatically classify genes into discrete clusters based on patterns of expression. The relative positions of genes in the human and mouse clusterings will then be examined. A different clustering would suggest that the respective transcriptomic landscape is different. The gene expression clusterings may be applied to highlight discrete drug-gene interactions in human versus mouse brains. Potential differing expressions may account for anatomical differences in mouse and human brains. Time permitting, the similarity of expression patterns in cerebral organoids will also be considered. The insights from this project may also be applied to single-cell cancer sequencing, where clusterings may be used to cluster and identify stages of cancer cell development.
