# braindev-analysis
Deep learning analysis of prenatal gene expression in neurological animal models.
## The Data
This project focuses on the analysis of two formats of data: matrices displaying normalized expression of a gene over several stages of development, over neuroanatomical regions, and raw images of ISH (in situ hybridization) results for genes over brain sections. 
## Methodology
Unsupervised image clustering will be implemented using the TensorFlow framework.
